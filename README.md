To use Ground_Station.ino properly and ensure the radio is configured correctly, the original RadioHead library needs to be downloaded
from here: https://github.com/hallard/RadioHead

The library folder needs to be put in the same folder as Ground_Station.ino during compilation.
The files RH_RF95.h and RH_RF95.cpp need to be replaced by the version that are in this repository.
